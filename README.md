## Introduction

[Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) is a "complete end-to-end testing experience". It allows you to write JavaScript test files that automate real browsers. For more details, see the [Cypress Overview](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/overview/why-cypress) page.

This recipe integrates a Cypress docker image with your DDEV project.

The main benefit is integration of Chrome and Firefox browsers out of the box, providing a known static state regardless of local OS or cloud CI/CS development. It also provides X11 display support for MacOS and Windows users, whereas this usually just works in Linux.

This addon:
- provides Cypress without the need to install <a href="https://nodejs.org">Node.js</a>
- provides Firefox and Chromium out of the box, preconfigured for Cypress
- configures your project's HTTPS site a base URL
- provides helper commands for running Cypress GUI or in headless mode

Installing Cypress with favorite package manager works great locally. However, maintaining a consistent node and browser environments across teams, operating systrems, CI/CS development pipelines and cloud development spaces can become a challenge.

<a href="https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/automated-testing/browser-testing-using-cypress">Browser testing using Cypress</a> sets up Cypress for Drupal manually. For Linux users this could be easier, since X11 and Firefox are usually already present.

## Requirements

- DDEV >= 1.19
- Modern OS
  - MacOS 10.9 and above (Intel or Apple Silicon 64-bit (x64 or arm64))
  - Linux Ubuntu 12.04 and above, Fedora 21 and Debian 8 (x86_64 or Arm 64-bit (x64 or arm64))
  - Windows 7 and above (64-bit)
- Interactive mode requires a X11 server running on the host machine.

## Steps

- Install service

  For DDEV v1.23.5 or above run

  ```shell
  ddev add-on get tyler36/ddev-cypress
  ```

  For earlier versions of DDEV run

  ```shell
  ddev get tyler36/ddev-cypress
  ```

  Then restart the project

  ```shell
  ddev restart
  ```

> [!NOTE]
> If you change `additional_hostnames` or `additional_fqdns`, you have to re-run `ddev add-on get tyler36/ddev-cypress`

- Run cypress via `ddev cypress-open` or `ddev cypress-run` (headless).

We recommend running `ddev cypress-open` first to create configuration and support files.
This addon sets `CYPRESS_baseUrl` to DDEV's primary URL in the `docker-compose.cypress.yaml`.

### Configure `DISPLAY`

To display the Cypress screen and browser output, you must configure a `DISPLAY` environment variable.

#### macOS

ddev Cypress Setup (Mac)

```bash
# Install XQuartz
brew install xquartz --cask

# Run XQuartz
open -a Xquartz
```

In the XQuartz preferences, go to the “Security” tab and make sure the “Allow connections from network clients” checkbox is checked.

Now __restart your Mac__.  XQuartz will not properly be set to listen for X11 connections until you do this.

```bash
# Run the below command
xhost + 127.0.0.1
```
Add a file called `docker-compose.cypress_extra.yaml` with the following content to the .ddev directory: 

```yaml
services:
  cypress:
    environment:
      - DISPLAY=host.docker.internal:0
```
#### Linux

You may need to set up access control for the X server for this to work. Install the xhost package (one is available for all distros) and run:

```sh
export DISPLAY=:0
xhost +
```

#### Windows 10

If you are running DDEV on Win10 or WSL2, you need to configure a display server on Win10.
You are free to use any X11-compatible server. A configuration-free solution is to install [GWSL via the Windows Store](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/gwsl/9nl6kd1h33v3#activetab=pivot:overviewtab).

##### Running DDEV on Win10 (not WSL)

- Install [GWSL via the Windows Store](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/gwsl/9nl6kd1h33v3#activetab=pivot:overviewtab)
- Get you "IPv4 Address" for your "Ethernet adapter" via networking panel or by typing `ipconfig` in a terminal. The address in the below example is `192.168.0.196`

```shell
❯ ipconfig

Windows IP Configuration


Ethernet adapter Ethernet:

   Connection-specific DNS Suffix  . :
   IPv4 Address. . . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.0.196
   Subnet Mask . . . . . . . . . . . : 255.255.255.0
   Default Gateway . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.0.1
```

- In your project `./docker-compose.cypress.yaml`, add the IPv4 address and `:0` (For example `192.168.0.196:0` ) to the display section under environment.

```yaml
    environment:
      - DISPLAY=192.168.0.196:0
```

### A note about the Cypress image

This recipe uses the latest `cypress/include` image which includes the following browsers:

- Chrome
- Firefox
- Electron

Best practice encourages using a [specific image tag](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-docker-images#best-practice).

- If you require a specific browser, update `image` in your `./.ddev/docker-compose.cypress.yaml`.
- Available images and versions are available on the [cypress-docker-images](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-docker-images) page.

## Commands

Cypress can run into 2 different modes: interactive and runner.
This recipe includes 2 alias commands to help you use Cypress.

To see Cypress in interactive mode, Cypress forward XVFB messages out of the Cypress container into an X11 server running on the host machine. Each OS has different options. Developers have reported success with the following:

- Windows 10 / WSL users:
  - [GWSL](https://opticos.github.io/gwsl/tutorials/manual.html) (via [Microsoft store](ms-windows-store://pdp/?productid=9NL6KD1H33V3))
  - [VcXsrv](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/) (via [chocolatey](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/vcxsrv#versionhistory)).
- Mac users:
  - [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/). See [Running GUI applications using Docker for Mac](https://sourabhbajaj.com/blog/2017/02/07/gui-applications-docker-mac/).

### `cypress-open`

To open cypress in "interactive" mode, run the following command:

```shell
ddev cypress-open
```

See ["#cypress open" documentation](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-open) for a full list of available arguments.

Example: To open Cypress in interactive mode, and specify a config file

```shell
ddev cypress-open --config cypress.json
```

### `cypress-run`

To run Cypress in "runner" mode, run the following command:

```shell
ddev cypress-run
```

See [#cypress run](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-run) for a full list of available arguments.

Example: To run all Cypress tests, using Chrome in headless mode

```shell
ddev cypress-run --browser chrome
```

## Notes

- The dockerized Cypress *should* find any locally installed plugins in your project's `node_modules`; assuming they are install via npm or yarn.
- Some plugins may require specific settings, such as environmental variables. Pass them through via command arguments.

## Troubleshooting

### "Could not find a Cypress configuration file, exiting"

Cypress expects a directory structures containing the tests, plugins and support files.

- If the `./cypress` directory does not exist, it will scaffold out these directories, including a default `cypress.json` setting file and example tests when you first run `ddev cypress-open`.
- Make sure you have a `cypress.json` file in your project root, or use `--config [file]` argument to specify one.

### "Unable to open X display."

- This recipe forwards the Cypress GUI via an X11 / X410 server. Please ensure you have this working on your host system.
